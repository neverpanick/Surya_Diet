# 🚀 Hosting your project for free on GitHub Pages

Since your project is a static website (HTML, CSS, and JS), you can host it for free using **GitHub Pages**.

### Step 1: Push your latest changes
You have already done this! Every time we "Push to origin main", your code goes to GitHub.

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/neverpanick/Surya_Diet`
2. Click on the **Settings** tab (top right).
3. On the left sidebar, under "Code and automation", click **Pages**.
4. Under "Build and deployment" > "Source", ensure it says **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Under "Branch", select **main** and the folder **/(root)**.
6. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Access your site
*   Wait about 1-2 minutes for GitHub to build the site.
*   Refresh the **Pages** settings page. You will see a bar at the top that says:
    > "Your site is live at **https://neverpanick.github.io/Surya_Diet/**"

### 💡 Why GitHub Pages is great for this project:
- **Zero Cost**: It is completely free for public repositories.
- **Fast**: It uses a Global CDN, meaning it loads quickly anywhere in the world.
- **Auto-Sync**: Every time I help you update the code and push it, your website automatically updates.
- **HTTPS**: You get a secure SSL certificate (the green lock icon) automatically.

> [!NOTE]
> If you already have a custom domain (like `suryadiet.com`), you can also connect it to GitHub Pages in the same "Pages" settings menu.
